## Course Policies

- **Homework:** There will be weekly homework, counting to 50% of the grade.
- **Exams:** There will be one midterm and a final, which each count 25% of the grade. In both cases I will prepare practice exams. 
- **Letter grade:** Any score of 75% or higher will be worth an A.
- **Homework extension policy:** If you need an extension for any reason, please send us an email. Extensions of 48h will always be granted, provided that you requested one. Longer extension will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

**Remarks:** Mistakes are part of learning, so it is important to me that there is room for making mistakes and still earn a top grade. We're here to facilitate your learning.

You're welcome to discuss and collaborate on homework with your friends. Anything that facilitates your learning is greatly encouraged. But submitted homework must not be copied, and should be your solution in your own words. AI generated homework solutions will not be graded and will be reported and scored 0.
