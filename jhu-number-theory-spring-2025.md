## Course Description

This course offers an introduction to elementary number theory with minimal background prerequisites. Following George Andrews' Number Theory, we will cover essential concepts and some of the most celebrated results in elementary number theory, divisibility, the theorems of Fermat, Euler, and Wilson, the Chinese remainder theorem, prime numbers and factorization, some arithmetic functions, primitive roots, quadratic reciprocity, and Diophantine equations. Time permitting, additional topics from later chapters in the book, such as Pell’s equation, continued fractions, or factorization in the Gaussian integers, may also be included.

## Course material

We will roughly follow the book _Number Theory_ by George Andrews, and course notes provided by the lecturer.

## Organization

### Important Dates

- **First lecture:** January 21st.
- **First midterm:** February 25th.
- **Spring break:** March 17–24th.
- **Second midterm:** April 1st.
- **Final lecture:** April 24th.
- **Final exam:** May 8th.

The first midterm covers content up to February 13th.  
The second midterm covers content up to the spring break.

1. **Midterm 1** covers Chapters:
   - `chapter:induction`
   - `chapter:euclidean-division-and-representability`
   - `chapter:linear-diophantine-equations`
   - `chapter:fundamental-theorem-of-arithmetic`
   - `chapter:combinatorial-methods`
   
   from these notes, and Chapters 1, 2, and 3 from *Andrews, Number Theory*.  
   Note: parts of Chapter 3 of Andrews' book do not have an equivalent in these notes, so don't forget to study Chapter 3 of Andrews.

2. **Midterm 2** covers Chapters:
   - `chapter:polynomials`
   - `chapter:congruences`
   - `chapter:modular-arithmetic`
   - `chapter:systems-of-linear-congruences`
   - `chapter:polynomial-congruences`
   - `chapter:primitive-roots`
   
   from these notes, and Chapters 4, 5, 6.1, and 7 from *Andrews, Number Theory*.

### Grading

The course grade will be determined as follows:

- **Homework:** 60%
- **Each exam (two midterms and final):** 20% each

This adds up to a total of 120%, allowing students the opportunity to earn extra credit.

The grading scale is:

- **> 100%:** A+
- **90–100%:** A
- **80–90%:** B
- **70–80%:** C
- **60–70%:** D
- **< 60%:** F

If the median score for the class falls below a B, grades may be adjusted (curved) so that the median corresponds to a B. Any adjustments will be made consistently for all students.

## Lectures

### Tuesday 1/21, Lecture 1: History of Number Theory

First class! We give a short history of number theory, and get started with mathematical induction.

### Thursday 1/23, Lecture 2: Euclidean Division and the Representability Theorem

We review mathematical induction and prove the well-ordering theorem. We will then use the well-ordering theorem to prove the Euclidean division theorem and the representability theorem.
