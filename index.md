I am a postdoc in the Department of Mathematics at [Johns Hopkins University](https://mathematics.jhu.edu) in Baltimore, MD. My research focuses on the formalization of mathematics and homotopy type theory. I am the lead developer of the [agda-unimath library](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/), the biggest library of formalized mathematics in the Agda proof assistant, and author of the forthcoming book, _Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory_ ([ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11082)).

I have been part of the Homotopy Type Theory community since its inception, and as a member of the Univalent Foundations Program during the special year on univalent mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study I co-authored the book _Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics_. From 2014 to 2018 I did my PhD under [Steve Awodey](https://awodey.github.io) at Carnegie Mellon University. I have held postdoctoral positions at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with [Dan Grayson](https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/drg) and at the University of Ljubljana with [Andrej Bauer](https://www.andrej.com). I am currently working under [Emily Riehl](https://emilyriehl.github.io) at Johns Hopkins University.
